# 1.20.5 server crash POC
In Minecraft 1.20.5, a bug has been discovered to allow players to crash a server consistently. This mod is a LabyMod addon to perform this crash. This can be done by controlling the bytes of certain inventory packets.

This was discovered by [mat-1](https://github.com/mat-1).
